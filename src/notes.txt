stopped on lecture 228 (start with 229)

from lecture 230
install the lodash dependency, then
You can then import flowRight into your file like so:

import { flowRight } from 'lodash';
and just replace any place in the lesson where we use compose with flowRight:

export default compose(
  //...code 
)(CollectionItemContainer);
becomes

export default flowRight(
  // ...code
)(CollectionItemContainer);
You can find out more about this breaking change here as well: https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/3330. So push forward with the lesson :)
